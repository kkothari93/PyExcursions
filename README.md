# PyExcursions
Repo for my excursions in python

### 1 Fractals 
Testing classes and inheritance in Python
Generating FJC polymer chain - will be used to study polymer statistics

### 2 RNN
Testing recurrent neural networks on binary addition

### 3 Euler*.py
Attempts to improve programming skills by solving problems on Project Euler

### CUMTD bus stop info
A handy utility to get real-time info on buses on UIUC campus right into the python IDE.
Developed because leaving Python -> opening Chrome -> navigating to website is too much work! :/
