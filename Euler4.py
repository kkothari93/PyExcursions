"""
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# 1) Any palindrome with even number of digits is divisible by 11
# Since we need to find the largest palindrome <abccba> using product
# of two three digit numbers we will use this to use the greatest numbers
# divisible by 11 < 1000 as one of the factors.

# 2) Since we want to find the largest palindrome, we start off by
# assuming a = 9. If that is so, the last digits of the two factors have to be:
# (1, 9), (3, 3), (7, 7)
